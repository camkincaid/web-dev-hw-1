**My Experience So Far**

*Let me tell you, its not been so bad at all. The hardest part was understanding the layout of github and what was assigned. Other than that, I've been enjoying this assignment and the class. Very excited to learn!*

**The Overwhelming Things**
- Having 2 Coding Classes
- Working Full Time
- *Doing Homework Again In General!*

**Things To Be Excited For**
1. *Michael*, remember you love to learn.
2. Learning to code is already a big interest of mine.
3. I get to make webpages! This class seems so fun!

```This must be code block... Anyways, I'm hoping Creative Coding and this class will kind of hold hands somewhat. The class already had me download atom so they are somewhat synced. Either way should be a great semester!```

Since we are required to provide a link, here is one to my **[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/ravenmj)**. I create music in the little spare time that I have! :)
