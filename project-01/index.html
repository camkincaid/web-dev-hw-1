      <h1>To a Stranger</h1>
      <h4>Walt Whitman</h4>
      <p>Passing stranger! you do not know how longingly I look upon you,
        <br/>
        You must be he I was seeking, or she I was seeking, (it comes to me as of a dream,)
        <br/>
        I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you,
        <br/>
        All is recallâ€™d as we flit by each other, fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured,
        <br/>
        You grew up with me, were a boy with me or a girl with me,
        <br/>
        I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not
        <br/>
         yours only nor left my body mine only,
        <br/>
        You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh, as we pass, you
        <br/>
        take of my beard, breast, hands, in return,
        <br/>
        I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or
        <br/>
         wake at night alone,
        <br/>
        I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again,
        <br/>
        I am to see to it that I do not lose you.</p>
